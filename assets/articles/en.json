Regular distance breaks **relax accommodation**, reduce spasm, and can ease symptoms like headaches, dryness, and blurred vision.\n\n### How to implement\n1. Set a 20-minute timer or use an app reminder.\n2. Place a small sticker near your monitor as a visual cue.\n3. Combine with **blink breaks** (consciously blink 10 times).\n4. Pair with good **lighting** and **screen distance (40–50 cm)**.\n\n> Tip: If you're deep in study, use the 20–8–2 pattern per hour: **20 min** focused, **8 min** light movement, **2 min** outdoor light if possible."

    "bodyMarkdown": "# Break Timers & Helpful Apps: Building Sustainable Eye Health Habits\n\n## Why We Need Break Reminders\n\nIn our hyperconnected world, it's alarmingly easy to lose track of time when working on screens. Research shows that:\n\n- **90% of people** forget to take regular breaks when focused on digital tasks\n- **Blink rate drops** from normal 15-20 times per minute to just 3-5 times during screen use\n- **Eye strain symptoms** develop within 2 hours of continuous screen use\n- **Productivity actually decreases** after 90 minutes of focused work without breaks\n\n### The Science Behind Forgetting\n\n**Cognitive tunneling**:\n- **Flow state**: When deeply engaged, we lose awareness of time and bodily needs\n- **Attention narrowing**: Focus becomes so intense we ignore peripheral signals\n- **Dopamine loops**: Digital engagement creates reward cycles that are hard to break\n- **Executive function overload**: Working memory gets so full we forget basic self-care\n\n**Physiological factors**:\n- **Reduced blink rate**: Less lubrication leads to dry, irritated eyes\n- **Accommodative fatigue**: Eye muscles become locked in near-focus mode\n- **Poor posture**: We slump forward, reducing blood flow to eyes and brain\n- **Dehydration**: We forget to drink water during intense focus\n\n## Types of Break Reminder Systems\n\n### 1. Operating System Built-in Tools\n\n**Windows 10/11**:\n- **Focus Assist**: Automatically blocks notifications during focus time\n- **Screen Time**: Tracks usage and sets limits\n- **Break Reminders**: Built-in timer with customizable intervals\n- **Night Light**: Automatically reduces blue light in evening\n\n**macOS**:\n- **Screen Time**: Comprehensive usage tracking and limits\n- **Focus Mode**: Blocks distracting apps and notifications\n- **Do Not Disturb**: Scheduled quiet periods\n- **Night Shift**: Automatic blue light reduction\n\n**iOS/iPadOS**:\n- **Screen Time**: App usage limits and downtime\n- **Focus**: Customizable focus modes with notifications\n- **Break Reminders**: Built-in wellness features\n- **App Limits**: Set maximum daily usage for specific apps\n\n**Android**:\n- **Digital Wellbeing**: Usage tracking and app timers\n- **Focus Mode**: Block distracting apps during work\n- **Bedtime Mode**: Automatic evening screen dimming\n- **Break Reminders**: Wellness timer features\n\n### 2.
